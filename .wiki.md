# Project Summary
The AI Vulnerability Scanner project aims to enhance the security of AI models by detecting vulnerabilities in code through advanced machine learning techniques. It focuses on ensuring that datasets are effectively integrated into the model training process, thereby improving the reliability and safety of AI systems. This project provides a robust solution for identifying vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and others in various programming languages.

# Project Module Description
The project comprises several functional modules:
- **Dataset Loader**: Loads and preprocesses datasets, including generating synthetic data for training.
- **Model Trainer**: Trains the AI vulnerability detection model using machine learning algorithms.
- **Vulnerability Scanner**: Scans code for vulnerabilities using both machine learning and rule-based methods.
- **API**: Provides endpoints for scanning and retrieving scan results, built using FastAPI.
